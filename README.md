## Why is This Project Different?

Ever used an online AI tool and been left staring at a spinning loader with no idea what's happening? ImageRepair AI is engineered to be different. It's not just a script, but a robust service designed for a transparent and interactive user experience.

-   **Intelligent Task Queue**: We use an asynchronous, multi-worker task queue on the backend. This means you can submit multiple images, and the system will process them efficiently without freezing. You'll even know your position in the queue.

-   **Real-Time Status & Control**: Every job you submit gets a unique Task ID.Use our API to get live updates on your image's status‚Äîfrom "pending" to "processing" to "completed".If you change your mind, you can even request to cancel an ongoing task. 

-   **Dual-AI Enhancement Pipeline**: We combine the strengths of two powerful AI models.**GFPGAN** focuses on restoring faces with stunning realism, while **Real-ESRGAN** upscales and enhances the entire image background.The result is a comprehensively repaired photo.

-   **User-Centric Interface**: The frontend is designed for a smooth workflow, featuring a multi-language interface, an interactive before/after comparison slider, and the ability to process images directly from a URL.

-   **Built for Deployment**: With pre-configured Docker setups for both CPU and GPU, you can deploy this project with a single command, confident that the environment is consistent and reliable.

## üöÄ Getting Started

The recommended way to run this project is with Docker, which handles all dependencies automatically.

### Prerequisites

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
-   **(For GPU acceleration)**: A compatible [NVIDIA GPU with drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) and the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).

### Installation & Launch

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/diandiancha/ImageRepair-AI.git](https://github.com/diandiancha/ImageRepair-AI.git)
    cd ImageRepair-AI
    ```

2.  **Launch with Docker Compose:**

    -   **For CPU Version** (works on any system):
        ```bash
        docker-compose -f docker-compose.cpu.yml up --build
        ```
        - [cite_start]Access the web interface at: `http://localhost:5002` [cite: 9]

    -   **For GPU Version** (for high performance with an NVIDIA GPU):
        ```bash
        docker-compose -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up --build
        ```
        - [cite_start]Access the web interface at: `http://localhost:5001` [cite: 1]

The `--build` flag is only necessary for the first launch.

<summary>üíª **For Developers: Manual Python Virtual Environment Setup**</summary>

This method is for users who want to run the application outside of Docker.

1.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**
    ```bash
    # From the project's root directory
    python -m venv venv
    
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    [cite_start]The dependencies are listed in `backend/requirements.txt`. [cite: 2]

    -   **For CPU-only:**
        ```bash
        pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url [https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu)
        pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
        ```

    -   **For GPU-acceleration (NVIDIA CUDA required):**
        [cite_start]This command is based on the instructions in the original `Readme.txt`. [cite: 6]
        ```bash
        pip install torch==2.1.2+cu121 torchvision==0.16.2+cu121 torchaudio==2.1.2 --extra-index-url [https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121)
        pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
        ```

3.  **Download AI Models**
    The Docker build process does this automatically, but for a manual setup, you must download the models yourself. [cite_start]The required models are specified in the Dockerfiles. [cite: 8, 3]
    ```bash
    # Create the directory
    mkdir backend/models

    # Download models into the new directory
    wget -O backend/models/GFPGANv1.4.pth [https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v1.3.0/GFPGANv1.4.pth](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v1.3.0/GFPGANv1.4.pth)
    wget -O backend/models/RealESRGAN_x4plus.pth [https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/releases/download/v0.1.0/RealESRGAN_x4plus.pth](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/releases/download/v0.1.0/RealESRGAN_x4plus.pth)
    ```

4.  **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    python backend/app.py
    ```
    - The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.
